# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Project Overview
For this project, We are going to Neural Networks Machine Learning algorithms, also known as artificial neural networks, or ANN. For coding, We are using Python TensorFlow library in order to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by nonprofit foundation Alphabet soup.

## Requirements
- Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Optimize the Model

 “IS_SUCCESSFULL” column is the target.
- Target variables are also known as dependent variable and we are using this variable to train our ML model.

## How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

## Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

- Yes. After few configurations we achieve the target model performance.
- The model accuracy improved to 76.16%. Figures below show accuracy score after optimization at  76.16% and before optimization at 72.44%.
